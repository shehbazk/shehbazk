# Hi there friends ðŸ‘‹

Being from a non-CS/IT background, I've been a self taught developer since 2 years. I have worked on multiple technologies like React.js, Java, Express.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, mySQL and MongoDB
I like to collaborate with new people help them. Anyone can feel free to reach me out for help or anything else.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Backend development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on frontend projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with open source
